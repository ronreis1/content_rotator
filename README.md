# content_rotator
This is a script to put on a web page for rotating content. 
Inside a div loops some paragraphs using timers and recursion.
It fades in-out the paragraphs indefinitely to see the different content on it.
CSS rules set paragraphs for the first time.
The script add a counter and run a function that fades in the paragraph.
After the fade in animation completed, it runs a callback function.
Use an if/else statement to check the last paragraph and call the content rotator function again.
